## To do

### Project development
* 3: Creating a new cover

* 4: Saving & viewing covers
  * When a user clicks the “Save Cover” button, the current cover will be added to the savedCovers array
  * If a user clicks the “Save Cover” more than once on a single cover, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates)
  * When a user clicks the “View Saved Covers” button, we should see the saved covers section
  * All the covers in the savedCovers array should be displayed in the saved covers section
  * Note: None of this needs to persist on page load
* 5: Deleting Saved Covers
  * From the saved covers view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted
  * Hint: How will you update the data model to achieve this? Hint: Look into this user event Note: None of this needs to persist on page load (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/dblclick_event)
* 6: Extensions
  * Here’s a list of possible extensions to implement - but ONLY IF your team has completed all the previous iterations AND have cleaned up your code to make it DRYer and more readable.
  * You are welcome to add your own extensions. Be sure they are thoughtful in terms of UX/UI, and that they do not break any prior functionality.
  * Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable the button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
  * When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
  * Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear

### Refactoring
* refactor CSS to create responsive layout
* deploy to GitHub
* launch GitHub pages
