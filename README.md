# RomCom

Have you ever wanted to write a romance novel, but didn't know where to start? Find your inspiration with RomCom! Generate your romance novel cover image, title, and tagline, and get your steamy story started!

## To do

### Project development
* 5: Deleting Saved Covers

* 6: Extensions
  * Here’s a list of possible extensions to implement - but ONLY IF your team has completed all the previous iterations AND have cleaned up your code to make it DRYer and more readable.
  * You are welcome to add your own extensions. Be sure they are thoughtful in terms of UX/UI, and that they do not break any prior functionality.
  * Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable the button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
  * When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
  * Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear

### Refactoring
* refactor CSS to create responsive layout
* deploy to GitHub
* launch GitHub pages
