## To do

### Project development

- 6: Extensions
  - Responsive layout / mobile styles
  - add by line to form / DOM
  - add button to hide instructions
  - Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable the button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
  - When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
  - Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
  - "flatten" saved covers to a single icon / image (currently this is creating an innerHtml that only allows a user to save the `overlay` element)
