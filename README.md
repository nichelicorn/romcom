## To do
### Refactoring
* hide saved covers on form view
* add navigation key to saved covers view
* add header / footer
* relocate controls to the side of the page?
* refactor CSS to create responsive layout
* deploy to GitHub
* launch GitHub pages
### Project development
* 6: Extensions
  * Here’s a list of possible extensions to implement - but ONLY IF your team has completed all the previous iterations AND have cleaned up your code to make it DRYer and more readable.
  * You are welcome to add your own extensions. Be sure they are thoughtful in terms of UX/UI, and that they do not break any prior functionality.
  * Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable the button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
  * When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
  * Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
  * "flatten" saved covers to a single icon / image (currently this is creating an innerHtml that only allows a user to save the `overlay` element)
